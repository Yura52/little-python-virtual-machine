# Python Bytecode Interpreter
A little virtual machine for executing Python bytecode. The project was implemented in 2016 and the supported Python version is likely to be 3.4 or 3.5. While only a subset of the language is supported, some "less than trivial" are implemented (e.g. closures, exceptions).
